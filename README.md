# Pandas-challenge
A School and standardized test data were analyzed by creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. 

- To create a District Summary, the necessary calculations were performed and a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame was created.

- To create a School summary, the necessary calculations were performed and then a DataFrame, that summarizes key metrics about each school, was creted.

## Conclusions
- Small (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) schools showed better performance than large(2000 -5000)school with an Overall passing persentage 89.8-90.6% vs 58.2%.
- Budget spending per student doesnâ€™t guarantee passing (>70) and high test results. Despite having higher spending per student than smaller and medium sized, large schools have lower test results.
- District schools have lower test results across all metrics than Charter schools.
- Large-sized public schools have the lowest test results in Math.
